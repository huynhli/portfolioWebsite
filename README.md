# My Portfolio Website!

This is the repo for my portfolio website hosted [here](https://liamhuynh.pages.dev/). 

It was made with Golang, Fiber, CORS, Typescript, React + React Router, and Vite. 

It was deployed using Cloudflare Pages and Render. 

It uses MongoDB Atlas and Cloudinary for database and cloud storage, as well as OAuth with Github for authentication.

Check out my other projects at my [Github profile]() or [on Itch.io](), or shoot me an email at liamtamh@gmail.com. Thanks for stopping by!
